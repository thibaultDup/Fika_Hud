Fork's Author : thibaultD
Original project : Kl_HudV2

## Added Features:

- Resized and Repositioned :desktop_computer:
- Dynamic color changing of stats when reaching thresholds :red_square:
- Display of the players money accounts (wallet, bank, dirty money) :dollar:
- Display of the company money accounts (only displayed for the company's PDG) :dollar:


## Removed Features: 

- Display of the stress stat

## Requirements:

Changes have been developed on a server running the ESX framework 1.3 (compatible 1.2).

The ideal would be to use the Hud on an ESX based server or having at least the following scripts : 

- es_extended
- esx_basicneeds
- esx_addonaccounts


## Installation: 

1. Download the ZIP, extract it, rename Fika_Hud (if necessary)
2. Put the Fika_Hud in the resources folder
3. Add this line to the server.cfg (after all the esx start) : ensure Fika_Hud

_To have a cleaner general HUD, disable the basic top right HUD by going in the es_extended/config.lua file and changing the HudDisplay to False._


## TODO LIST:
X

## Other:
